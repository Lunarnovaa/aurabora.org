So, around August of last year I started following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) with the goal of learning web design and eventually getting a job in the field. After learning the basics of HTML and CSS over the course of a couple weeks, however, I decided that career path was not for me, and since then I have begun studying Anthropology in college. For the most part, I put those aspirations behind me and set to focus on other passions of mine.

While I still am certain that this is not a field I would like to make a career out of, I have discovered a significant passion for it.

Cut to now, where I have written a website for my own personal blogging, compiling and sharing a list of resources for various subjects and interests, and, well, anything else I may decide to use it for.

They outline important features of this *"Personal Web"* as RSS, Blogging, community-based messaging systems + webrings, and most importantly, personal websites.

Ultimately, this video crafted the image of a web based upon creation, community, and personalization. This appealed to me. I recall listening to a tech podcast (a guilty pleasure of mine) that described the current way through which the average person uses the Internet as being through a set of 3-5 corporate-controlled websites at the most, with most people rarely going beyond that within a browser. After all, what do you need beyond YouTube, Amazon, G-Suite, and maybe Twitch? (Note that between those sites, just *two* corporations own them collectively).
