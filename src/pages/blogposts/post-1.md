So, around August of last year I started following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) with the goal of learning web design and eventually getting a job in the field. After learning the basics of HTML and CSS over the course of a couple weeks, however, I decided that career path was not for me, and since then I have begun studying Anthropology in college. For the most part, I put those aspirations behind me and set to focus on other passions of mine.

In June of this year, however, I made the switch to **NixOS**, a linux distribution that can be best summed up as "computing by code," where configuration, installation, and management of packages is done through coding. Through this process, I learned much about **Git**, developed useful skills and habits for coding, and found a lot of enjoyment from the process. While I still am certain that this is not a field I would like to make a career out of, I have discovered a significant passion for it.

Cut to now, where I have written a website for my own personal blogging, compiling and sharing a list of resources for various subjects and interests, and, well, anything else I may decide to use it for. So how did I end up here? Well, that's the subject of this first blogpost. I will give you one spoiler: *it was much easier than I thought it would be*.

## Interest in the "Personal Web"

A few months ago, a friend of mine sent me a video titled [Basic Guide To The Personal Web](https://youtu.be/zswyWBtF-7Y) In this video, the creator details several components and skills one may wish to learn and explore in order to escape the corporate-terraformed landscape of the Internet and return to a more free terrain. They outline important features of this *"Personal Web"* as RSS, Blogging, community-based messaging systems + webrings, and most importantly, personal websites.

Ultimately, this video crafted the image of a web based upon creation, community, and personalization. This appealed to me. I recall listening to a tech podcast (a guilty pleasure of mine) that described the current way through which the average person uses the Internet as being through a set of 3-5 corporate-controlled websites at the most, with most people rarely going beyond that within a browser. After all, what do you need beyond YouTube, Amazon, G-Suite, and maybe Twitch? (Note that between those sites, just *two* corporations own them collectively). In comparison lied a vision of a personally crafted Internet---one truly "free as in freedom," not "free as in paid-for-by-data."

But this is all very abstract and frankly philosophical, so let's get a bit more down to earth.

## Long-Form, Not Bite-Sized

When I was but a wee lass, I discovered the magic of Twitter; suddenly all my private thoughts could become public, my day could be journaled, and my ideas and aspirations expressed freely. All in the span of 140 characters. This is what I would call "Bite-Sized Writing," writing one must fit in a short span. Of course we wrote *threads* when needed, not just individual tweets, but the message was to write short enough for someone absent-mindedly scrolling through their feed after school or work to be able to grasp without needing to exert too much attention.

Call me old-fashioned, but I don't think we should be breaking up the important things to us into 140- (or 240-) character-sized chunks. Do I think conciseness is important? Yes. But I want to be able to express the depth of my thoughts, not just briefly scratch the surface. (By the way, in case you're curious, this post is so far at about 3,559 characters not including formatting---that would be a 13 tweet long thread today.)

### A Tangent On Internet Immortality

As I grew older, I moved my sharing to Discord, "infodumping" everything in a special channel my friends made for that exact purpose. Here, we could (and were encouraged to) rant as long as we wanted. But there's a catch: it's *Discord.* If you want to scroll back up to that ancient rant you wrote that one time, good luck, pray to whatever superpowerful force/entity you believe in, and hope Discord's search feature works alright. And hope even tighter that Discord *never* goes away, because if it does, every single thing you ever ranted about goes away forever with it. And if you think I'm paranoid, and that Discord will never go away, I'm guessing you joined the Internet later than I did and missed all the previous chatting platforms like Skype, Teamspeak, Steam Messages, and a bunch of others that used to be super popular that all gradually have gone into disuse, everything said on it disappearing into the abyss of the forgotten Internet. 

It's painfully common to see people treat Discord---be it servers or DMs---as timeless Internet Archives. Even I've often used it for long-term storage of files I don't want to lose, stored instructions on tech solutions and modding for my friends, and compliations of resources that I found helpful. But I've come to realize this is a seriously dangerous use of Discord. Discord is an Internet messaging application, and it should be treated that way. Nothing on Discord is going to stay there forever. *Discord* is not going to stay there forever. This is another reason why I'm building this website---to replace a couple of those "long-term storage" uses of Discord. 

## Wisdom From the Past

So... what option do we have? 

Well, I've recently come into knowledge of an age-old form of journaling that ancient peoples used to refer to as *"Blogging."* Apparently, you just wrote stuff and hosted it on the Internet somewhere. People even bought domains. Crazy, huh?

It does sound crazy when we're so used to how our contemporary, corporate-Internet functions. But really, it makes a lot of sense. Here are some neat things about it:

1. It encourages long-form content by having each post/rant have its own page
2. You can pretty much choose who has access to its contents by choosing who/where you do or do not share the URL
3. If you have the time and interest, you can even style your website to personalize it and make it pretty. It's a kind of artform if you want it to be.
4. You can make easy backups simply by storing/downloading the source code right onto any Hard Drive or USB Drive
5. Related to the above, it's timeless---HTML and CSS are never going away, they've been here for the past 40 years and will be here for another. 

If you watched the video I linked earlier in this blogpost, you've heard most of the points above. Obviously, I'm biased towards this system. I've worked on it, it fits my skillset and passions, it affirms some of my political and philosophical views, and I've invested time into it.

So, for the sake of fairness, I'm going to go over one unfortunate issue I can foresee people having with this: it's simply less convenient.

## The Fruits of Inconvenience; Or, Inputs and Outputs

Around a year ago, for my first ever college course, I read *The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains.* As someone who has been using the Internet since the age of 4 (no, I wasn't an iPad kid, I was a Windows kid), when I saw this book on the reading list, I was instantly a little uncomfortable. The idea of something I've literally grown up with being something that has had adverse effects on my development and existence wasn't something I was sure how to handle. Yet as I read it, I came to understand that it held information broader than its central thesis regarding the Internet; that *convenience is a trap for decay*.

Now, if that sounds kinda wild, I don't blame you. Isn't convenience good?
